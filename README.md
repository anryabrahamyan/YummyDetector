# Yummy Detector

The user takes a picture of a meal (a salad, or any other meal that consists of different types of ingredients),
and the program uses an API to recognize each of the ingredients and then calculates the amount of nutrition that each ingredient has. 
It collects data on a daily basis and according to that data, it provides the user with the amount of 
nutrition they have eaten through histograms by their total and mean values.
